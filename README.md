# Summary:
The [Discourse MT Shared Task](https://github.com/wildre-workshop/wildre-7_discourse-mt) is a part of the [7th Workshop on Indian Language Data: Resources and Evaluation (WILDRE-7)](http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in/conf/wildre7/index.jsp).
# Introduction:
<p align="justify"> The primary objective of this shared task is to advance the state-of-the-art in machine translation by promoting research and development of systems that can seamlessly handle discourse-level information with a focus on Indian languages. Participants are encouraged to explore innovative approaches that go beyond sentence-level translation and incorporate discourse markers, anaphora resolution, and cohesive structures to produce more contextually aware and natural-sounding translations.
  In the shared task, participants will be provided training and dev datasets containing Indian languages' parallel texts at both sentence and discourse levels. These datasets may include diverse genres and domains to ensure the generalizability of the proposed models. The focus will be on languages with varying discourse structures, encouraging the exploration of language-specific challenges in discourse-aware translation. The evaluation set will be designed to test the models' ability to handle unseen examples of discourse and maintain coherence in various communicative contexts. The submitted system will be evaluated on both automatic machine translation metrics (such as BLEU, CHRF++ and TER) and human evaluation metrics designed to assess discourse coherence. </p>
